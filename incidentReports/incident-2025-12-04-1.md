**December 4, between 8am – 2pm MST**

*Summary*

Between the hours of 8am and 2pm on December 4 users did not encounter any chaos issues. No chaos-related failures occurred, but there was two  ‘Active Users’ incidents during the test window. The incident was caused by the fact that the expected factory-initiated chaos did not happen which resulted in not impacting the JWT Pizza system. This incident revealed that several alert rules were not set up properly to detect the chaos failures. 

*Detection*

As stated in the summary, there were two ‘Active Users’ incidents during the test window – 10:08am and 12:11pm. I was alerted through the ‘Active Users’ alert rule that there was more than one active user on the JWT Pizza site. 
At the end of the chaos testing window, 2:00pm, without receiving any chaos alerts. My ‘Chaos’ visualization remained at a zero for the entire testing window. I realized there was an issue with the alerting system I had set up prior. 

*Impact*

Because there was no chaos alerts triggered, there was no impact to the JWT Pizza system.

*Timeline*

•	Dec 4 – 8:00am
o	Simulated traffic on JWT Pizza and verified metrics were showing in Grafana
•	Dec 4 – 10:09am
o	‘Active Users’ alert and visualization showed that there were two active users. Alert was resolved.
•	Dec 4 – 12:11pm
o	Active Users’ alert and visualization showed that there were two active users. Alert was resolved.
•	Dec 4 – 2:00pm
o	Chaos testing window ended with no chaos triggered alerts
•	Dec 4 – 2:25pm
o	Manual chaos triggered for testing. Chaos alerts fired as expected.

*Response*

After noticing that the factory chaos never triggered by chaos alerts, I began checking my alert rules in Grafana and seeing where I can improve my alert conditions. I confirmed that my dashboards were updating and working normally. I confirmed that when I locally turn on chaos I am sent chaos notifications and the chaos calls are seen on the ‘Chaos’ visualization board. 

*Root Cause*

I believe that the root cause may be that my chaos alert rule threshold may have been too low. I had my chaos alert threshold to alert any chaos above 0. After research, I decided to change this threshold to be alert any chaos that is above or equal to 1. 

*Resolution*

The incident was resolved by running local chaos to confirm that the chaos alerting worked, which it did. I changed the chaos alert threshold from above 0 to above or equal to 1. I’m hoping this update will help the system detect real chaos in the future. 

*Prevention*

This root cause resulted in the factory chaos not being detected and chaos alerts not going off during the chaos testing window. 

*Action Items*

1.	Add monitoring for factory chaos activation
2.	Improve failure detection thresholds
3.	Enhance visualization for metrics
